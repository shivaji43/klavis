## Authentication

The server uses Close CRM's access token authentication. You need to provide your Close access token in the Authorization header when making requests:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CLOSE_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

or via the x-auth-token header:

```
x-auth-token: YOUR_CLOSE_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

To get your access token:
1. Log in to your Close account
2. Go to Settings â†’ API Keys
3. Generate a new access token

## API Endpoints

The server runs on port 5000 by default and provides the following endpoints:

- `/sse` - Server-Sent Events endpoint for real-time communication

## Error Handling

The server provides comprehensive error handling with detailed error messages for debugging. All errors are returned in JSON format with both user-friendly messages and developer-specific details.

## Rate Limits

The server respects Close CRM's API rate limits and implements appropriate request throttling to prevent API quota exhaustion.

## Contributing

This MCP server follows the same architecture pattern as other MCP servers in this repository. The codebase is organized into:

- `server.py` - Main server application
- `tools/` - Tool implementations organized by resource type
- `tools/base.py` - Base client and common utilities
- `tools/constants.py` - API constants and enums

When adding new features, follow the existing patterns and ensure proper error handling and logging.
